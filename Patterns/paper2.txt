Blender (The Blender Foundation) 
Did you love Flash, but now need an “easy to learn and use” equivalent for 
3D animation software? If so, then you should start here. Not only is it small 
and not processor demanding, but it’s also free and comes with a Web community that
 offers hundreds of free classes and tutorials on its site. It’s also been used to 
make award winning short films and has plenty of advanced features that are worth checking out


Blend for Visual Studio helps you design XAML-based Windows desktop, web, 
Windows Phone, and Windows Store apps. It provides the same basic XAML design experience as Visual Studio and adds visual designers
 for advanced tasks such as animations and behaviors.

and low processor demanding, but it’s also offers hundreds of free classes and tutorials on its site for beginners.It supports the complex of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, 
animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking,video editing and  also game creation.

Poser (Smith Micro Software)
If your job is to just 3D model, skin, rig, scene light, texture, or any other 3D 
specialty, then you’re the unsung hero on AnimationCareerReview, and you have our 
staff’s respect! However, if you just exclusively want to work on animation, and 
showcase purely your animation skills, then why bother with the rest? If that describes 
you, then Poser should be high on your consideration list since it comes with a free library 
of base human and animal 3D meshes that will save you large amounts of time. Yes, it can do
other things as well, but not as well as the others on this list.
